This comprehensive guide will help you get started with Intercom. We recommend you take the following steps as a priority, as these will unlock further features and functionality for you and your team to get the most out of Intercom.

 

Weâ€™ve broken it up into sections:

Connect with your customers

Add and configure your team

Build your knowledge base

Meet your AI Agent

Connect your apps  optional 

Message your customers  optional 

 

Step 1: Connect with your customers 

First, connect with customers by installing the Messenger and enabling omnichannel communication such as email, phone, SMS, and WhatsApp so your customers can reach you wherever they are, and your team can handle everything in one place. This provides the best customer support experience because it allows you to collect data for personalization, enable Fin AI Agent to resolve queries or hand them over to an agent, and send outbound messages. 

 

Install the Messenger code
Whether the plan is to install the Messenger in a dev environment or in production first, be sure to start this process straight away. From the installation page, youâ€™ll find two code snippets to (1) Install for visitors (2) Install for logged-in users, we recommend installing the Messenger for both.

Install the Messenger for visitors

Install the Messenger for logged-in users

If youâ€™re waiting for your engineer to complete the installation, go ahead and finish customizing your Messenger so youâ€™re ready to use it when they are ðŸ‘‡

 

Set up and customize the Messenger
Customize to have a Messenger that looks and feels exactly like your brand, and suits your preferences such as when youâ€™re available to chat and how inbound conversations are handled.

Support inbound/outbound emails
To send emails from your business or shared email address and improve open rates, youâ€™ll first need to verify your domain. Then allow email forwarding from your address(es) to Intercom and manage all inbound email from your chosen inbox. With â€˜sender addressâ€™ also configured, if a customer contacts you through support@examply.com, then your replies will also come from support@examply.com.

Step 2: Add and configure your team 

Time to invite your team! These steps set your business up for success by defining some of the basic roles and permissions that will be used going forward. Most of them only need to be configured once, and they will make it easy for you to manage your team as you grow. 

 

Create custom roles to manage permissions
Custom roles are reusable sets of permissions that you can assign to teammates when you invite them to your Intercom workspace. They also make it simple to update permissions for a large group of people all at once.

Create custom roles.

 

Add teammates
Now you can ask teammates to join your workspace and set their permissions. Depending on your plan, you can also assign lite seats to collaborate with teammates outside of your Support team.

Step 3: Build your knowledge base

The next crucial step to setting up a successful customer service offering is building your knowledge base with support content. Having a good content early on enables you to automate more than 50% of inbound conversations using our AI Agent, provide all teammates with a personal AI assistant, and increase the number of customers who self-serve via your Help Center. Plus, itâ€™s more efficient to manage all your internal and external content in one place.

 

Create, sync or import your public help content
Start by creating public articles or syncing / importing your existing knowledge base from Zendesk. Then customize your on-brand help center and set it live so customers can self-serve. To use these articles with Fin AI Agent and provide customers with instant answers, you can decide which content Fin has access to.

Create, sync or import your internal help content
Knowledge inside Intercom is also your internal knowledge management system for creating, syncing, or importing internal articles from Confluence, Guru, or Notion. To provide teammates with their own personal AI assistant in the inbox, you can enable these articles for Copilot.

Step 4: Meet your AI Agent

 

After investing in a tip-top knowledge base, youâ€™re ready to test that knowledge with Fin AI Agent and witness the real magic of good quality content. Fin is the key to instantly resolving 50% of your support queries. It improves your customer experience by reducing wait times and boosting CSAT scores, and frees your team up to focus on the most complex issues, or transition into value-oriented roles like customer success. You can see it all in action before any of your customers and learn exactly how Fin behaves.

 

Enable content and preview Fin AI Agent
All Fin needs to perform well and start resolving conversations is your support content, so youâ€™ll need to get this added before you can preview and start interacting with Fin in the Messenger.

Add your support content.

Use the interactive Messenger preview to ask Fin some questions.

 

Test Fin with a specific audience
If youâ€™d like to test Fin internally with teammates, or trial it on a specific group of customers, itâ€™s easy to do this using audience rules.

Share Fin with your team or specific customers.
